# Introduction

This document outlines the overall project architecture for Free Kick Master, a browser-based 3D football arcade game. The architecture is designed as a client-side monolithic application using Three.js for 3D rendering, with all game logic running in the browser and data persistence via localStorage.

**Relationship to Frontend Architecture:**
This is a frontend-only application. All UI, game logic, and 3D rendering are handled client-side. There is no separate backend architecture document needed.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

**Decision:** N/A - Greenfield project. Will use Vite as build tool for fast development and optimized production builds.
